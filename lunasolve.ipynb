    "LunaSolve is a service dedicated to optimizing business solutions by offering tailored software and hardware options for tackling optimization challenges. With our user-centric approach, you can create optimization instances using a documented high-level specification, or upload problems using industry-standard modeling formats. Once submitted, our AI-driven recommendation engine suggests suitable software and hardware based on your specific use case. We then leverage quantum computers to handle the challenge, process the data, and deliver the solution. Through post-processing techniques, we convert raw quantum data into a human-readable format before sharing the response with you.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using LunaSolve, you typically follow three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transformation:** Go from your problem definition to a (quantum-ready) mathematical format\n",
    "- **Recommendation:** Get a suggestion on the best combination of software and hardware for your use case\n",
    "- **Solve:** Solve the problem on quantum or classical hardware, or a combination of both.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started with LunaSolve, refer to the [Get Started page](https://docs.aqarios.com/get-started) for instructions. Once you've set the foundation, you can directly dive into the service and start solving your optimization challenges."

    "## Transformation: How to create optimization problem instances\n",
    "\n",
    "To start solving an optimization problem, the first step is to define which problem you want to solve in the first place. You have two different approaches how to formulate the problem: You can either choose an optimization problem from our [use case library](https://docs.aqarios.com/use-cases) or directly provide your use case in a mathematical modeling format. At the moment, we only support QUBOs as predefined modeling formats, but other modelling languages will be included in future versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Access our use case library\n",
    "\n",
    "We provide users with a built-in library of (currently) more than 40 different optimization problems which can be configured using human-readable data formats such as graphs or lists. These are then automatically transformed into appropriate mathematical representations for optimization algorithms and quantum hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "The list of currently available optimizations can be retrieved from our [use case library](https://docs.aqarios.com/use-cases). Here, you can also find detailed information on how to specify each problem formulation, i.e. which parameters you need to provide for each optimization problem and which format they should be in.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, let's say you want to solve a Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). From our use case library, you can find all information about the use case, including a description, a link to a detailed description of the mathematical model, and any parameters necessary to create a problem instance. Here, you will see that to create an instance of TSP, the only data you need to provide is a graph. This graph can either be a nested dictionary or can be created from `networkx`. We recommend the latter approach."
