    "Aqarios Luna is a platform designed to facilitate the application of quantum technologies, providing services that span the entire journey from from formulating a use case to achieving a quantum-powered solution. Luna's primary focus is on solving complex optimization problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the business challenges faced by companies today can be formulated as optimization problems, whether in supply chain management, portfolio optimization, or balancing demand and supply for electricity. However, a significant portion of our real-world optimization problems is so complex that they cannot be solved efficiently - or even not at all, using our current hardware, *classical computers*. This results in inefficient workflows and huge untapped potential throughout our entire economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is precisely where **Quantum Computing** will shine. The quantum leap in computing power and speed will empower us to efficiently tackle these optimization problems, leading to unparalleled advances in our economic future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luna enables businesses to harness quantum technology and solve the most complex business problems. While quantum computers hold tremendous potential, the complexity associated with developing, understanding, and applying the necessary quantum algorithms remains a major challgenge for many stakeholders. Luna offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface for accessing quantum hardware and applying quantum algorithm. This eliminates the needs to delve into the mechanics behind quantum algorithms, instead focusing on solving problems and achieving solutions. At the same time, Luna offers full customization and flexibility for users with the necessary expertise who wish to explore further depths. "
