    "## Part 1: Introduction\n",
    "Many business problems that companies face today can be formulated as optimization problems, whether in supply chain management, portfolio optimization, or balancing demand and supply for electricity. However, many of our real-world optimization problems are so complex that they cannot be solved efficiently or at all with our current hardware - *classical computers*. This leads to extremely inefficient workflows throughout our economy and huge losses that can even run into the billions for larger companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly where **Quantum Computing** will come into their own. The huge leap in computing power and speed will allow us to efficiently solve these optimization problems, leading to unimaginable advances in the future of our economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aqarios Luna is a platform that will enable businesses to benefit from quantum technology and solve the most complex business problems. While quantum computers have tremendous potential, the complexity of communicating with them as well as understanding and applying the algorithms is a major hurdle to overcome and one that many companies struggle with. This is where we come in - Luna provides an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for accessing and applying quantum computing from the perspective of a business user - the use case and its solution. With Luna, there is no need to understand how quantum algorithms work in order to apply them. At the same time, Luna offers full customization and flexibility for those users who have the necessary knowledge and want to delve deeper.\n"

    "- **Transform**: You can provide us with your use case in a predefined but intuitive and easy to understand format, which we will automatically transform into the necessary format to solve the problem on quantum devices.\n",
    "- **Recommend**: We give you a recommendation on the best algorithm and hardware to use to solve your specific problem.\n",
    "- **Solve**: You tell us which solver you want to use - we take care of everything necessary to get the algorithm onto quantum hardware and solve your problem.\n",

LunaSolve can support developers of optimization heuristics by unifying the access point to both classical and quantum solvers. \n",

This kind of functionality can be easily achieved using LunaSolve, as the business logic behind the novel heuristic can be written and maintained in the desired programming language and corresponding repository, while the Luna platform acts as a signel point of access to the solving heuristics which must be called inside the custom algorithm."
